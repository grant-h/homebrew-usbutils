# Homebrew usbutils

Homebrew forumula for https://github.com/grant-h/usbutils

```
brew tap grant-h/usbutils
brew install --HEAD usbutils
```

Currently the formula is HEAD only (meaning Homebrew must compile it). Bottles may be coming soon to avoid the dependency on autotools/automake. Also, this may be merged into Homebrew core to avoid needing to tap.
